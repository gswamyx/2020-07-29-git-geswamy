## The basics

- `git init`: create a repository in your current folder
- `git status`: Show current status, once commit is done, working tree is clean

- `git add <filepath>`: Add modified untracked files to staging area
- `git commit`: Make the commit - enter comments describing the commit in editor
  - `git commmit -m "your message"`: write <message> to commit in 1 step
